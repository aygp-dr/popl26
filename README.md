Personal research tracker for the **53rd ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages** (POPL 2026).

## About POPL

POPL is the premier forum for discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. The symposium welcomes both theoretical and experimental papers, seeking contributions that make principled, enduring contributions to:

- **Theory** of programming languages
- **Design** of programming languages and systems
- **Understanding** of language semantics and behavior
- **Implementation** techniques and optimizations
- **Application** of programming language concepts

### Topics of Interest

| Category | Topics |
|----------|--------|
| **Language Design** | Type systems, module systems, domain-specific languages, language interoperability |
| **Semantics** | Operational semantics, denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics, game semantics |
| **Verification** | Program correctness, theorem proving, model checking, static analysis |
| **Concurrency** | Parallel programming, distributed systems, memory models, synchronization |
| **Security** | Information flow, access control, secure compilation, privacy |
| **Implementation** | Compilers, interpreters, runtime systems, garbage collection, JIT compilation |
| **Logic** | Type theory, proof theory, linear logic, separation logic |
| **Applications** | Probabilistic programming, quantum computing, machine learning, systems programming |

## Conference Details

- **Venue**: Le Couvent des Jacobins, Rennes, France
- **Dates**: January 11-17, 2026
- **Sponsors**: ACM SIGPLAN (in cooperation with SIGACT and SIGLOG)
